# Connect Four Game

A test driven development of the ["Connect Four"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game.

## Setup
`git clone git@github.com:marwei/connect-four-game.git`

## Run
`ruby demo.rb`

## Test
`rake rspec`

(Okay I'll admit it, I was asked to implement the winner-checking funtion for the game but got a little carried away...)
